# nodeJsServer
Simple nodejs server for quick debugging and intercepting incoming requests

Tested on Node v6.10.2  ( but should work on anything above 6.x.x)

How To run it :

  - adjust the port number to your taste 
  - point your application that you want to monitor to that port 
  - ```sh 
    node mysrver.js
 ```
 
  - See all the rest calls in the console 
  - Enjoy
